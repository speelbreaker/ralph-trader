+#### **1.0.Y Instrument Lifecycle & Expiry Safety (Expiry Cliff Guard) — MUST implement**
+
+**Purpose:** Instruments expire/delist. After expiry, venue APIs may return "invalid instrument"/"not_found"/"orderbook_closed".
+These are **expected terminal lifecycle events**, not fatal system errors. The Soldier MUST remain panic-free and MUST protect
+the rest of the portfolio from a single instrument disappearing.
+
+**Required instrument fields (from venue metadata; cached under §1.0.X):**
+- `expiration_timestamp_ms: Option<i64>` (epoch ms; null for perps)
+- `is_active: bool` (or equivalent venue state)
+- `instrument_state: enum { Active, DelistingSoon, ExpiredOrDelisted }` (derived)
+
+**Delist buffer rule (fail-closed for opens):**
+- If `expiration_timestamp_ms` is present and `now_ms >= expiration_timestamp_ms - (expiry_delist_buffer_s * 1000)`:
+  - NEW OPEN intents for that instrument MUST be rejected before dispatch with `Rejected(InstrumentExpiredOrDelisted)`.
+  - CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL intents remain allowed (subject to Kill hard-stop and other gates).
+
+**Terminal error classification (panic-free):**
+- Any venue response that semantically maps to {`invalid_instrument`, `not_found`, `orderbook_closed`, `instrument_not_open`}
+  for an instrument with `expiration_timestamp_ms` present and `now_ms >= expiration_timestamp_ms` MUST be classified as:
+  - `Terminal(InstrumentExpiredOrDelisted)`
+  - MUST NOT panic
+  - MUST NOT force process restart
+  - MUST trigger reconciliation for that instrument only (ledger/orders/trades/positions) and then mark `instrument_state=ExpiredOrDelisted`.
+
+**Idempotent cancel rule (expiry-safe):**
+- If a CANCEL is issued for an order on an expired/delisted instrument and the venue returns a terminal lifecycle error,
+  the CANCEL MUST be treated as **idempotently successful** (order is considered gone).
+
+**Portfolio-wide reconcile/flatten (expiry-safe):**
+- During any portfolio-wide reconcile/flatten procedure (restart reconcile, emergency flatten, operator shutdown flow),
+  terminal lifecycle errors for expired/delisted instruments MUST NOT abort the procedure.
+- The procedure MUST continue managing other instruments normally.
+- If venue truth (positions snapshot) indicates no remaining position for the expired/delisted instrument, the system MUST
+  mark `instrument_state=ExpiredOrDelisted` and MUST NOT enter a retry loop for that instrument.
+
+**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**
+AT-949
+- Given: `expiration_timestamp_ms = Texp`, `now_ms = Texp + 1000`, and a CANCEL is attempted on that instrument.

+### **1.2.3 Self-Impact Feedback Loop Guard (Echo Chamber Breaker)**
+
+**Goal:** Prevent the bot from reacting to its own impact and recursively increasing exposure (“echo chamber”).
+This is a **safety guard**, not a strategy feature.
+
+**Where:** `soldier/core/risk/self_impact_guard.rs`
+
+**Inputs (minimum):**
+- Rolling public market volume estimate over `feedback_loop_window_s` (USD notional): `public_notional_usd`
+- Rolling self trade notional over the same window (USD notional): `self_notional_usd`
+- `public_trades_last_update_ts_ms` (epoch ms; freshness timestamp for public trade feed aggregation)
+- `now_ms`
+- Intended action classification (OPEN vs CLOSE/HEDGE/CANCEL)
+
+**Freshness precondition (non-negotiable):**
+- If `now_ms - public_trades_last_update_ts_ms > public_trade_feed_max_age_ms` OR the field is missing/unparseable:
+  - The Self-Impact guard MUST NOT compute `self_fraction`.
+  - Instead, the system MUST treat this as a trades-feed liveness failure:
+    - Set `RiskState::Degraded`
+    - Set Open Permission Latch reason `WS_TRADES_GAP_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`
+    - Block opens until reconciliation clears the latch.
+
+**Computation (only when feed is fresh):**
+- `self_fraction = self_notional_usd / max(public_notional_usd, epsilon)`
+- Trip condition (any):
+  A) `self_fraction >= self_trade_fraction_trip` AND `self_notional_usd >= self_trade_min_self_notional_usd`
+  B) `self_notional_usd >= self_trade_notional_trip_usd`
+- If trip condition is met for a proposed OPEN in the same direction as recent self trades:
+  - Reject the OPEN intent before dispatch with `Rejected(FeedbackLoopGuardActive)`
+  - Apply cooldown: block further OPENs for `feedback_loop_cooldown_s` for the affected `{strategy_id, structure_fingerprint}` key.
+
+**Acceptance Tests (REQUIRED):**

+- Given: `public_trades_last_update_ts_ms` is stale beyond `public_trade_feed_max_age_ms`.
+- When: the Self-Impact guard evaluates a new OPEN intent.
+- Then: it does NOT compute `self_fraction`; it sets `RiskState::Degraded` and sets Open Permission Latch reason `WS_TRADES_GAP_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`.
+- Pass criteria: OPEN blocked due to latch; no `Rejected(FeedbackLoopGuardActive)` is emitted.
+- Fail criteria: FeedbackLoopGuard trips (or computes) while trade feed is stale OR OPEN dispatch occurs.

+  - All other gates are configured to pass (this test isolates the Self-Impact guard)
+- When: an OPEN intent is evaluated.
+- Then: the intent is rejected with `Rejected(FeedbackLoopGuardActive)` and no dispatch occurs.

+  - All other gates are configured to pass
+- When: an OPEN intent is evaluated.
+- Then: the intent is rejected with `Rejected(FeedbackLoopGuardActive)` via the notional-trip rule.
