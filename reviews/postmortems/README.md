# PR Postmortems

Purpose
- Each PR must add a filled postmortem entry based on PR_POSTMORTEM_TEMPLATE.md.
- Entries are structured for parsing and enforcement.

Naming
- Use YYYY-MM-DD_<short-description>.md

Rules
- Every PR must include at least one entry file in this folder.
- Entries must follow PR_POSTMORTEM_TEMPLATE.md and include all sections 0–3.
- If a recurring issue is identified in the postmortem, update WORKFLOW_FRICTION.md with the next elevation action.
