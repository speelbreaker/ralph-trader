# WORKFLOW_FRICTION

Purpose
- Rolling list of the top workflow constraints.
- Each recurring item must name a next elevation action (script check, contract clarification, or test).

How to use
- Keep the Active list to the top 3 constraints only.
- When a constraint recurs, add/refresh the entry and point to the enforcement path.
- Move resolved items to Resolved with the date and a short note.

## Active (Top 3)
| Date | Constraint | Impact | Recurrence count | Next elevation action (script_check | contract_clarification | test) | Target path | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| YYYY-MM-DD | | | 0 | | | |
| YYYY-MM-DD | | | 0 | | | |
| YYYY-MM-DD | | | 0 | | | |

## Resolved
