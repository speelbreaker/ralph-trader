# WORKFLOW_FRICTION

Purpose
- Rolling list of the top workflow constraints.
- Each recurring item must name a next elevation action (script check, contract clarification, or test).

How to use
- Keep the Active list to the top 3 constraints only.
- Rank by TOC impact (1 = highest constraint).
- Each entry must include Constraint, Exploit, Elevate, and Next action.

## Active (Top 3)
| Rank | Constraint | Exploit (what we do now) | Elevate (permanent fix) | Next action | Owner | Proof target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Resolved
| Date resolved | Constraint | Resolution | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| YYYY-MM-DD | | | |
