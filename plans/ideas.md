# Deferred Ideas (append-only)

- Use this log for non-PRD ideas, follow-ups, or enhancements.
- Keep entries short and timestamped.
- Do not remove items; mark resolved by appending a note.

## Entries

- [YYYY-MM-DD] TBD
- Consider documenting Codex sandbox + worktree gotcha: Ralph/Codex cannot commit if .git lives outside the workspace; prefer a full clone inside the workspace.
